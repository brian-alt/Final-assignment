### Explination of Variable Chosen

I chose if people got treatment so I could make the comparison of people who have a mental illness and people who got treatment for their mental illness, to see if there were any major differences between countries. this would allow me in the future to see if further analysis on those countries with different variables should be explored to figure out why there is a difference.  


Explination of Visualization 

The first visualization depicts the number of people by country who got treatment. This visualization leaves out countries where the entire population in that country said no to treatment. The second visualization is the total number of people with mental illness by country. This visualization was altered so that only the countries from the frist visualization appear so comparisons could be made.
