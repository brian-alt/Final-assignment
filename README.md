### Explination of Variable Chosen

I chose if people got treatment so I could make the comparison of people who have a mental illness and people who got treatment for their mental illness, to see if there were any major differences between countries. this would allow me in the future to see if further analysis on those countries with different variables should be explored to figure out why there is a difference.
